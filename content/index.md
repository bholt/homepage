I’m a first-year computer science PhD student in the [Sampa][] and [PLSE][] groups at the [University of Washington][uw], advised by [Luis Ceze][luisceze], [Dan Grossman][djg], and [Emina Torlak][emina]. I’m interested in how programming
languages and computer architectures can evolve and cooperate to
address the competing demands of performance, energy efficiency, and accuracy. I’m supported by the [David Notkin Endowed Graduate Fellowship][notkin].

I collaborate frequently with [Kathryn McKinley][mckinley] and [Todd Mytkowicz][toddm] from [Microsoft Research][msr], where I was an intern twice, in 2011 and 2012, and a software engineer for nine months in 2014.

In 2013 I graduated with a [Bachelor of Philosophy][phb] from the [Australian National University][anu], advised by [Steve Blackburn][steveb]. I earned first-class honours and the University Medal in computer science.
