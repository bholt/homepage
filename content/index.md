I’m a first-year computer science PhD student in the [Sampa][] group at the [University of Washington][uw], advised by [Luis Ceze][luisceze] and [Dan Grossman][djg]. I’m interested in how programming languages evolve when hardware is unreliable, abstractions are rigid and outdated, and energy efficiency is critical. I’m supported by the [David Notkin Endowed Graduate Fellowship][notkin].

I collaborate frequently with [Kathryn McKinley][mckinley] and [Todd Mytkowicz][toddm] from [Microsoft Research][msr], where I was an intern twice, in 2011 and 2012, and a software engineer for nine months in 2014.

In 2013 I graduated with a [Bachelor of Philosophy][phb] from the [Australian National University][anu], advised by [Steve Blackburn][steveb]. I earned first-class honours and the University Medal in computer science.
